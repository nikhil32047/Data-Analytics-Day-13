1️⃣ Data Warehousing Basics:
=======================
What it is: A data warehouse is a centralized system where data from multiple sources is stored for analysis and reporting.

Key idea: It’s optimized for querying and analytics, not for transaction processing.

Example: A retail chain collects daily sales, inventory, and customer data from different stores, storing them in a data warehouse like Snowflake for analysis.


2️⃣ OLTP vs OLAP:
==============
OLTP (Online Transaction Processing): Handles day-to-day operations (inserts, updates, deletes) quickly.

OLAP (Online Analytical Processing): Handles large-scale data analysis and complex queries.

Example:

OLTP: Booking a train ticket online.

OLAP: Analyzing last year’s ticket sales trends.


3️⃣ Dimensional Modeling:
=====================
Concept: A method for designing databases to support business queries efficiently.

Types: Star Schema, Snowflake Schema.

Example: A sales data warehouse where Fact Table contains sales amounts, and Dimension Tables store product, location, and time details.


4️⃣ ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load):
=================================
Extract: Pull data from source systems.

Transform: Clean and convert data into a suitable format.

Load: Store data into the warehouse.

Example: A company pulling CRM customer data (Extract), fixing missing phone numbers (Transform), and storing it in BigQuery (Load).


5️⃣ Data Warehouse Tools Overview:
============================
Examples: Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Microsoft Azure Synapse.

Why important: They provide fast, scalable, and cost-effective analytics capabilities.
